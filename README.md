# Data Sekho:  Python-Pandas-EDA

This repository contains a mix of Python codes that I implemented during a bootcamp, along with detailed notes on key concepts related to data manipulation and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

### Project & Notes Overview:

- **Day 1: Python Fundamentals**
  - Implemented Python basics like variables, data types, loops, and functions.
  - Explored libraries like **NumPy** and **Pandas** for basic data manipulation.
  - Notes on Python fundamentals and data manipulation techniques.

- **Day 2: Data Collection & Preprocessing**
  - Collected data using **APIs** and explored **web scraping** techniques.
  - Implemented data cleaning with **Pandas**, handling missing values.
  - Notes on API usage, web scraping techniques, and data preprocessing strategies.

- **Day 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Worked on descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.) using **Pandas**.
  - Created visualizations with **Matplotlib** to identify trends and patterns in data.
  - Developed a final EDA project that includes a complete data analysis with visual insights.
  - Notes on EDA techniques, visualization best practices, and data storytelling.

### Skills Demonstrated:
- Python programming (variables, loops, functions)
- Data collection (APIs, web scraping)
- Data cleaning & manipulation (Pandas)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques (descriptive stats, visual
