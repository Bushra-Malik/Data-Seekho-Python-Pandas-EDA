# Data Sekho:  Python-Pandas-EDA
This repository contains code implemented during a bootcamp, showcasing skills in Python programming, data manipulation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

### Projects Overview:

- **Day 1: Python Fundamentals**
  - Implemented Python basics such as variables, data types, loops, and functions.
  - Worked with libraries like **NumPy** and **Pandas** for basic data manipulation.

- **Day 2: Data Collection & Preprocessing**
  - Applied **web scraping** techniques and collected data using **APIs**.
  - Cleaned and preprocessed the collected data using **Pandas**, including handling missing values.

- **Day 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Performed **descriptive statistics** (mean, median, mode, etc.) to understand the data.
  - Created visualizations using **Matplotlib** to identify patterns and trends.
  - Developed a final EDA project where I analyzed a real-world dataset, showcasing multiple visualizations and key insights.

### Skills Demonstrated:
- Python programming fundamentals (variables, loops, functions)
- Data collection (APIs, web scraping)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing data, organizing datasets with Pandas)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (descriptive statistics, data visualization with Matplotlib)
